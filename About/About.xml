	<description>A framework for processors to transform items and more, read player features!

Main Feature
A processor takes a set of ingredients and turns it autonomously into a product over a period of time. The framework supports a huge variety of settings to individualize the processes and brings easy to use UI for players, as well as several other improvements, like better textures.

Players benefits:
- New HD barrel texture
- Barrel can be made of any wood type
- Brewery can be made of any wood type
- ITab to quickly select products and ingredients
- Products are shown on the processing building
- Performance-improvements over vanilla
- Button in settings to replace vanilla barrels

The mod is mainly aimed at mod authors who want to add any sort of processor to their mod or make an existing object a processor. Documentation can be found in the wiki on Github: https://github.com/Syrchalis/ProcessorFramework/wiki</description>
